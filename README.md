## Usage

### Installation

> **Note:** Since this project is currently in active development, there is no installer (`.msi` or setup `.exe`) yet. To set up the application permanently (Start Menu icon, Autostart), please follow the manual steps below.

1. **Download** the latest `razer-battery-report.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/xzeldon/razer-battery-report/releases/latest).

2. **Move the executable** to a safe permanent location.
   * *Recommended:* Create a folder at `C:\Program Files\Razer Battery Report\` and move the `.exe` there.
   * *Note:* This prevents accidental deletion from your Downloads folder.

3. **Add to Startup** (Recommended):
   * Right-click `razer-battery-report.exe` -> **Create shortcut**.
   * Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup` and press Enter.
   * Move the created shortcut into the opened folder.
   * *Now the app will start automatically when you log in.*

4. **Add to Start Menu** (Optional):
   * Create another shortcut.
   * Press `Win + R`, type `shell:programs` and press Enter.
   * Move the shortcut into the opened folder.
   * *Now you can search for "Razer Battery Report" in Windows Search.*

> **Tips:**
> - You can rename the shortcuts to simply **"Razer Battery Report"** (remove ".exe" and "Shortcut").
> - **Custom Icon:**
>   1. Download [`mouse.ico`](https://github.com/xzeldon/razer-battery-report/raw/master/assets/mouse.ico) (save it in the same folder as the `.exe`).
>   2. Right-click the shortcut -> **Properties** -> **Change Icon...** -> **Browse** -> Select the downloaded `.ico` file.

## Adding new devices yourself

- add device with `name`, `pid`, `interface`, `usage_page`, `usage` to [devices.rs](/src/devices.rs)
- add `transaction_id` to switch statement in `DeviceInfo` in [devices.rs](/src/devices.rs)

> You can grab `pid` and other data from the [openrazer](https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/blob/352d13c416f42e572016c02fd10a52fc9848644a/driver/razermouse_driver.h#L9)
